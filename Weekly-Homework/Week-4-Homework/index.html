  <h4>About the Game</h4>
  <p>Gather your party, and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.
  Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a Mind Flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.
  From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.</p>

    <h4>Gather Your Party</h4>

      with a hand-crafted background. Or tangle with your inner corruption as the Dark Urge, a fully customisable Origin hero with
      its own unique mechanics and story. Whoever you choose to be, adventure, loot, battle and romance your way across the Forgotten
      Realms and beyond. Gather your party. Take the adventure online as a party of up to four.</p>

          <h4>Astarion</h4>
          <p>Astarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries,
            serving a sadistic master until he was snatched away. Now he
            can walk in the light, but can he leave his wicked past

          <p>Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards
            of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very
            monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy
            of rejoining her people... if they do not execute her first.</p>

            Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion
            that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it, but time
            is not on his side.</p>
